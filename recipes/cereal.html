        It's literally just whatever cereal you bought from the store and then you pour milk in it. Why are you here?

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Any cereal. Fruit loops. Cap'n crunch. Build your own. Doesn't matter!</li>
            <li>Milk. Again, lots of flexibility here. One percent, two percent. Both are fine. Skim is for psychopaths.</li>
        </ul>
